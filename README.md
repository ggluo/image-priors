# Record of the project "All you need are DICOM images"

11, Nov

Since we lost the track of previous results and there are some ideas to improve PixelCNN, it'd be better to redo some experiments from the training of priors.

## TODO list

- [ ] add layer norm to PixelCNN model to make it more adaptive to repeatedly normalized inputs.
- [ ] to make casual convolution more efficient, add self-attention
- [ ] IN VIVO experment to test prior's performance with different contrast
- [ ] to support the prior trained with magnitude images
