# Using a learned prior as regularization for nonlinear MRI reconstruction

## TODOs

- [ ] provide a figure to show the overview of the concept and idea behind this work
- [ ] provide a figure to show the improvement in the image quality as a result of using diffusion prior for phase augmentation
- [ ] provide a figure show the convergence of the proposed algorithm and phase maps
- [ ] provide a figure to compare the performance of different priors
- [ ] provide a figure to show the results for cross-domain validation for the different priors and how it demonstrates the property of a learnt prior
